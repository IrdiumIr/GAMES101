## Course Topics(mainly 4 parts)
### Rasterization(光栅化)
* **Project** geometry primitives (3D triangles / polygons) onto the screen
* Break projected primitives into **fragments** (pixels)
* Gold standard in Video Games (*Real-time* Applications)
### Curves and Meshes(曲线&网格)
* How to represent geometry in Computer Graphics
### Ray Tracing(光线追踪)
* Shoot rays from the camera though each pixel
    * Calculate **intersection** and **shading**
    * Continue to **bounce** the rays till they hit light sources 
* Gold standard in Animations / Movies (*Offline* Applications)
### Animation / Simulation(动画 / 模拟)
* Key frame Animation
* Mass-spring System
