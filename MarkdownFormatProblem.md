Due to the reason that *Github* cannot display *Latex* formula well in *Markdown* files, you may not have a comfortable reading experience while reading my notes even though you have installed ***[MathJax Plugin for Github]*** in your Chrome / Edge browser.
Maybe you can clone or fork this repository to use it.
I would be honored if it could help you.
